# rpi_motor_controller
A Raspberry Pi Pico based controller for HobbyWing EZRUN ESC's!

This repo is designed to send pwm commands to a R/C car ESC over the Raspberry Pi Pico's GPIO pins.
The repo is specifically designed for a HobbyWing EZRUN Max10 ESC so other ESC's especially ones from
other brands will more than likely not work since they will most likely require a different arming sequence
than the Max10.
